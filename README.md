## Drought and Crop Yield

#### Project Proposal:
Throughout the years, droughts have received more attention especially by weather specialists. With climate change being actively tracked, it is important for us to understand drought patterns and how they will relate to crop yield, which will help us understand global food security for the coming years. Recently, there has been a growing food demand with an increase in the world population along with drastic changes in the weather patterns. Through this study, we plan to help farmers understand the extreme changes within weather patterns and how it will impact crop yield by understanding previous crop yield and loss patterns. 


#### Proposed Project: 
We will understand the relationship trend between crop yield and drought pattern in North and South America, and try to comprehend which crops are less correlated to drought data indications. Throughout this project, we will want to get a better knowledge of drought impact on agriculture and to extend further, how crops are currently affected by climate change. 

#### Questions to answer:
* Which crops are less correlated to drought data indications? If we have some crops that are less correlated, will this crop be a ‘good-yield’ crop in the areas that are more prone to drought? 
* How has climate change impacted crop yields over the last few years and analyzing whether there were any extreme changes within North and South America crop yield patterns?
* As an addition, we would also want to understand the soil moisture data in correspondence to drought patterns and how soil moisture affects crop yields.

#### Limitations: 
Analyzing crop yield data requires tons and tons of data such as soil moisture, temperature, use of fertilizers. For better analysis and performance, it is important to obtain as much data as possible.
